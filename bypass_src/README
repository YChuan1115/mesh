Bypass is a tool for rerouting calls to UNIX system calls and
library procedures.

Please read doc/bypass.html.

If you are in a hurry to try Bypass without reading the
documentation, then do this:

On Linux or Solaris:

	% ./configure
	% make
	% setenv LD_PRELOAD `pwd`/examples/info_agent.so

On OSF/1 or IRIX:

	% ./configure
	% make
	% setenv _RLD_LIST `pwd`/examples/info_agent.so:DEFAULT

Now, run any program you like.  Try something simple like "ls -l" for
starters. The library "info_agent.so" instruments the read() and write()
system calls to record how much I/O is performed.  When a program performs the
exit() system call, a message giving the total I/O is displayed.

Here is an example of the output on Solaris:

	% ls -l info.h
	  -rw-r--r--   1 thain    23330        3404 Apr 11 13:40 info.h
	  NOTICE: 297267 bytes read, 62 bytes written.

To return to normal operation, unset the environment variable:

	% unsetenv LD_PRELOAD

	or

	% unsetenv _RLD_LIST

Further details are given in doc/bypass.html.
