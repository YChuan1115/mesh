<a name="client"></a>
<b>Mesh Client</b>
<br>
<br>

    The Mesh client performs all the steps necessary to execute commands
    through the Mesh Proxy (MP) as if the MP itself did not exist.
    Commands that are allowed to pass through the MP can be executed as
    if the remote host were directly connected by simply prepending the
    client command "mc".  Besides executing remote commands, the client
    also includes an <a href="usage_advanced.html">OS-independent virtual
    file system</a> that allows files across all Mesh-enabled resources
    to be accessed using standard file system commands.

    <ul>
    <li>Requirements
    <br>
    <br>

        The client <b>requires Perl version 5.8.5 or above</b> to
        execute and has been tested successfully on Linux, OS X, and
        Windows under <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> and <a
        href="http://www.colinux.org">coLinux</a>.  Only SSH is required
        to use Mesh, however, so if these requirements cannot be met,
        it is possible to <a href="usage_noclient.html">use Mesh
        without the client</a>.  Note for Windows users, even if the
        client is not used, scp and sftp require functionality only
        found in the OpenSSH versions of these commands so <a
        href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> or <a
        href="http://www.colinux.org">coLinux</a> will still be needed.

        <br>
        <br>
    </li>

    <li>Installation
    <br>
    <br>
        <ol>
        <li><a href="http://www.example.com/mc">Download the client</a>
        and save to a file called "mc"
        <br>
        <br>
        </li>

        <li>Make the client executable using "chmod 700 mc"
        <br>
        <br>
        </li>

        <li>Move the client to a location in your $PATH
        <br>
        <br>
        </li>

        </ol>
    </li>

    <li><a name="sshconf"></a>SSH Configuration
    <br>
    <br>

        If your local user name differs from your user name in the
        target Mesh domain, it is recommended that the following be
        added to your ~/.ssh/config file, where "mesh_user_name"
        should be replaced with your user name within that domain:

            <pre>       Host mp.example.com map.example.com
            User mesh_user_name</pre>

        Alternatively, the client's -u option can be used as described
        in the next section.  If your local user name is the same as
        your user name within the target Mesh domain, no additional
        configuration or command-line options are required.

        <br>
        <br>
    </li>

    <li>Command-line Options
    <br>
    <br>
        <ul>
        <li>-b
        <br>
        <br>

        Disable user interaction for use within scripts.  Note that
        the client will fail if any interaction is required, which is
        normally only required when your Mesh key has expired or is
        otherwise unavailable.

        <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li>-g
        <br>
        <br>

        By default, the client will generate a new Mesh key only when
        the previous key has expired.  This option forces the
        generation of a new key.

        <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li>-k
        <br>
        <br>

        By default, the client leaves any SSH agents started on your
        behalf running for future invocations after the client exits.
        This option forces spawned agents to be killed before exiting.
        Note that "-b" automatically implies "-k".
        
        <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li>--keygen-user user
        <br>
        <br>

        This option specifies the user that should be used during key
        generation.  Note that this option requires that the
        administrator has enabled the ability to generate keys for the
        current or "-u" user by the given user.

        <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li>-u user
        <br>
        <br>

        Specify user name.  Note that this option <b>is required if your
        local user name differs from your user name within the target
        Mesh domain and you have not modified your <a
        href="#sshconf">SSH configuration</a> appropriately</b>.

        <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li>-v
        <br>
        <br>

        Enable verbose output for debugging purposes.

        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>

<a name="authorizations"></a>
<b>Mesh Authorizations</b>
<br>
<br>

    The basic set of operations that may be performed using Mesh is
    specified by the administrator.  To protect accounts from malicious
    use of Mesh keys, users must grant execute and write permissions to
    Mesh operations on each target system.

    <ol>
    <a name="execauth"></a>
    <li>Execute Authorization
    <br>
    <br>

        By default, even Mesh operations permitted by site policy are
        not allowed to execute on a given host.  To enable Mesh
        operations to a given host, the file ~/.meshrc must exist on
        that host, which can be created by invoking the following:

        <pre>    touch ~/.meshrc</pre>

        Note that this must only be done once for systems with shared
        home file systems.  Other systems must be authorized
        separately.  Once this file exists on a host, all operations
        permitted by site policy are allowed to execute on that host.

        <br>
        <br>
    </li>

    <a name="writeauth"></a>
    <li>Write Authorization
    <br>
    <br>

        By default, Mesh operations are not allowed to write to the
        file system on a given host.  To enable writes to a given
        directory on a given host, that directory must be added (on a
        separate line) to the ~/.meshrc file on that host.  For example,
        the following lines in ~/.meshrc

        <pre>    /nobackup4
    /tmp</pre>

        indicate that writes should be permitted to /nobackup4 and
        /tmp.  Each directory is the root of allowed writes, thus this
        configuration would allow writes to all files and directories
        rooted at /nobackup4 and /tmp (e.g. /nobackup4/some/dir,
        /tmp/some/file, etc.).

        <br>
        <br>

        Note that the root directory cannot be authorized.  Also note
        that dot files (i.e. ~/.*) in your home directory are never
        writable regardless of the contents of ~/.meshrc.

    </li>
    </ol>

<hr>
<a name="commands"></a>
<b>Mesh Commands</b>
<br>
<br>

    Examples of the use of commands that may be executable through
    Mesh are given below.  Note that Mesh commands must be <a
    href="#execauth">authorized for execution</a> on each target host
    and transfers to a given host must be <a
    href="#writeauth">authorized for writes</a>.  Note that before a
    given operation is performed, the client may ask for certain
    information, including the existing or new passphrase for
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa, authentication information for mp.example.com, and/or
    the authentication information for map.example.com.  

    <ul>
    <li>
    <b>File Transfer</b>
    <br>
    <br>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <b>bbftp</b>
            (<a href="http://doc.in2p3.fr/bbftp/3.2.0.bbftp.html">man page</a>)
        <br>

            <pre>    mc bbftp -e "put /foo/bar /tmp/foobar" host1.example.com</pre>

            Note that <b>you must use the fully-qualified domain name
            of the target host</b> (in this case, example.com) if
            you are not within the target Mesh domain.

            <br>
            <br>
        </li>

        <li>
        <b>rsync</b>
            (<a href="http://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync.html">man page</a>)
        <br>

            <pre>    mc rsync foobar host1:/tmp</pre>

            Note that even if your home directory has been <a
            href="#writeauth">authorized for writes</a>, <b>rsync
            transfers to your home directory will fail unless the "-T"
            or "--temp-dir" option is specified</b>.  This is because
            rsync uses temporary files starting with "." during
            transfers, which cannot be written in your home directory.
            By specifying an alternate temporary directory that is <a
            href="#writeauth">authorized for writes</a>, this problem
            can be avoided.  For example, the following uses /tmp as the
            temporary directory when files are transferred to the home
            directory.  Make sure that the temporary directory specified
            has enough space for the files being transferred.

            <pre>    mc rsync -T /tmp foobar host1:</pre>

<b>Mesh Troubleshooting</b>
<br>
<br>

    The following error messages may be encountered during Mesh client
    usage.  Note that the "-v" option can be given to the Mesh client
    to output additional debugging information.

    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>"WARNING: Your password has expired"
    <br>
    <br>

        This message indicates that your current password has expired
        and must be changed.

        <br>
        <br>
    </li>

    <li>"Permission denied (~/.meshrc not found)"
    <br>
    <br>

        This message indicates that you have not created a .meshrc file
        in your home directory on the target host.  Mesh commands must
        be <a href="#execauth">authorized for execution</a> on each

        <br>
        <br>
    </li>

    <li>"Permission denied (unauthorized command)"
    <br>
    <br>

        This message indicates that you have attempted an operation that
        is not currently authorized by your Mesh installation.  Check
        that the command line is valid and that the attempted command is
        one of the <a href="#commands">authorized commands</a>.  Certain
        options to <a href="#commands">authorized commands</a> may also
        be disallowed, but these should never be needed in standard
        usage scenarios.

        <br>
    </li>

    <li>Permission denied during file access (various forms)
    <br>
    <br>

        These messages indicate that you attempted to read or write a
        file for which such access is not allowed.  The most common
        cause is forgetting to <a href="#writeauth">authorize
        directories for writes</a>.  Reads and writes of ~/.* are
        never permitted.
